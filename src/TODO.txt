TODO:

	- Gonna need new splash banner options for social page
		- See if its possible to still use the same social page component but dynamically load css options depending on if its from home or social component.
	- Get this on github
	- Get sidenav working
		- Make sidenav its own component? 
		- Change grid to allow for sidenav to exist on its own?


		*****STRUCTURE CLEANUP*****
			- Really probably how it should be.
			- make grid

			- Make title its own component
			- Do buttons have to be their own component? probably not.
				- Delete buttons components... put them in splash banner component



	- Make shop an intrapage link

	- Make about page
		- Set up app.html to be able to handle changing sites :: DONE
		- maybe Make component "main site" and then components
		  for each "site" after 
		  	- prob best way
	- Set up shopify for existing products
	- Set up form for custom shoes
		- Talk to taylor about pricing for custom shoes
			- Do we base pricing off of shoe price + fixed custom price
			- Do we have taylor decide after the request is added, then 
			  make a new link for adding the custom shoe to that person's
			  cart
			  	- If so, need some easy way of creating this custom addition.
			  	- At that point, might as well create an interface for taylor 
			  	  to add any shoe, and within that specify if the shoe should
			  	  be added to the store or not.
			  	  	- Then we have to worry about the picture being provided. 
			  	  	  Meaning any requests must first be private shop adds then 
			  	  	  taylor can add them after she finishes them and can upload 
			  	  	  a pic of them.
	- See if its possible to hook a page up to instagram so that people can post pics of their shoes to the site.
