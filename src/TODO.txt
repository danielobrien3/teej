TODO:

	- Make shop an intrapage link

	- Set up shopify for existing products

	- Set up form for custom shoes
		- Talk to taylor about pricing for custom shoes
			- Do we base pricing off of shoe price + fixed custom price
			- Do we have taylor decide after the request is added, then 
			  make a new link for adding the custom shoe to that person's
			  cart
			  	- If so, need some easy way of creating this custom addition.
			  	- At that point, might as well create an interface for taylor 
			  	  to add any shoe, and within that specify if the shoe should
			  	  be added to the store or not.
			  	  	- Then we have to worry about the picture being provided. 
			  	  	  Meaning any requests must first be private shop adds then 
			  	  	  taylor can add them after she finishes them and can upload 
			  	  	  a pic of them.
